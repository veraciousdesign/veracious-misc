[Read the specifications on the Cardmarket API.](https://api.cardmarket.com/ws/documentation/API_2.0:Main_Page)

CMapi is a simple and easy way to connect to the Cardmarket API.
It is written in Java 11 to take advantage of some of the new features, but still having access to a long enough support cycle.


### Sample Code

1) Create an API connector

```Java
String url = "https://api.cardmarket.com/ws/v2.0/output.json/";

String appToken          = "";
String appSecret         = "";
String accessToken       = "";
String accessTokenSecret = "";

CMApi api = new CMApi(
	url,
	appToken,
	appSecret,
	accessToken,
	accessTokenSecret
);
```

2) Submit a request and fetch the response

```Java
int idProduct = 1234;

GetProductRequest req = new GetProductRequest(api, idProduct).submit();
if (!req.isSuccess()) {
	LOGGER.error("API call error: {}", req.getError());
	// return from the current process
}

ProductResponse res = req.getResponse();
ProductEntity product = res.getData();

// do something with the product
```


### TODO

* Implementing the remaining Requests/Responses
